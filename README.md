## OKAMIcraft Create Server-Side Mods

Installation Instructions:

- Create a Fabric 1.19.2 server.
- Run your server for the first time. (This generates the necessary folders.)
- Download the .zip file from our latest release.
- Replace the mods and config folders from your server with the folders from the downloaded .zip file.
- (Optional) Replace your server icon if you'd like a custom one.
  
That's it! Your server should now be running the OKAMIcraft Create modpack.
